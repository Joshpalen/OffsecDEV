## 🎯 Objective
(Design, deploy, tune network intrusion detection system)

---

## 🔍 Architecture
- Sensors: (SPAN/tap)  
- Collector / SIEM:  
- Rule sources: (ET, custom)  
- Alerting channel:

---

## ⚙️ Deployment Notes
- Hardware / VM specs:  
- Packet capture method: (af_packet, pcap)  
- Time sync: NTP config

---

## 🧾 Performance Metrics
- Packet drop rate:  
- Avg alerts/day:  
- CPU/memory usage:

---

## 🧩 Tuning Actions
- Thresholding rules for noisy signatures  
- Implement suppress lists for known benign traffic  
- Add contextual enrichment (asset tags)

---

## 🧭 Evaluation
- False positive rate:  
- Detection coverage gaps:
