Practice environment for intercepting, testing, and documenting web application behavior with Burp.

## Quick Steps

2. Define scope and targets → [[Targets]]
3. Perform discovery (Spider/Proxy) → log in [[Activity_Log]]
4. Explore Repeater/Intruder for specific requests
5. Capture evidence to `Evidence/` and create findings

 - Log requests: Use `Templates/Burp_Request_Log.md` (Templater → new note) and save under this project (e.g., `Requests/`)
