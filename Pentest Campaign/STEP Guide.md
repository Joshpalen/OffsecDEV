# 1) High-level campaign phases (one-line view)

1. Authorization & scoping (legal)
    
2. Planning & design (targets, messages, kill-switch)
    
3. Infrastructure provisioning (test domains, mail, landing pages)
    
4. Test & dry-run (internal safe tests)
    
5. Launch (authorized targets / intervals)
    
6. Monitor & respond (kill-switch if needed)
    
7. Evidence collection & normalization (SE Evidence Finder)
    
8. Analysis & report writing (Pentest Report + findings)
    
9. Debrief & remediation support
    
10. Retention / secure deletion (per ROE)

# 2) Create the campaign folder structure (in your Obsidian vault)

Suggested path: `/<VaultRoot>/Reports/<CAMPAIGN_ID>/`
