# Evidence & Findings Helpers

## Scripts
- `Run_Evidence_Finder.ps1` - PowerShell wrapper for collecting evidence
- `se_evidence_finder_copy.py` - Python core used by the wrapper
- `Generate_Findings.ps1` / `Generate_Findings_From_Scans.ps1` - create finding stubs from Nmap/Nessus scans

## Quick Use
```powershell
# Copy evidence into the campaign structure
./Run_Evidence_Finder.ps1 -Src "C:\temp\raw_evidence" -Campaign "Example Campaign" -Mode copy

# Generate finding notes from an Nmap XML file
./Generate_Findings.ps1 -Type nmap -Input .\02-Recon\scans\scan.xml -CampaignRoot "..\"
```

Keep evidence files under `Evidence/` and edit the generated Markdown stubs in `06-Reporting/Findings/`.
