Hi test,

We noticed an issue with your account. Please confirm the change by visiting the link below:

https://example.test/action?id=abc123

Thanks,  
Support Team

### Vishing Script
- Opening line: "Hi, this is Support from Global Rain."
- Verification: request employee ID and last helpdesk ticket
- Desired action: visit the confirmation link and provide the one-time code
- Abort conditions: user declines, mentions security team, or call becomes suspicious

### Physical / Social (Tailgating or Baiting)
- Cover story: vendor following up on helpdesk ticket
- Props: branded badge, clipboard
- Entry approach: accompany an employee through primary entrance
- Exit strategy: leave building immediately after interaction

---

## 6. Infrastructure & Tooling
- Phishing domains / hosting: example.test (staging)
- Mail server / SMTP provider: Burp mail relay
- Call spoofing / VOIP provider: test VOIP bridge
- Payload hosts / redirectors: internal staging host
- Tracking / telemetry: unique parameters per target, inbox monitoring
- Logging & evidence capture: proxy history, packet capture, screenshots
- Safety controls: only test accounts, automatic link expiry

---

## 7. Detection & Monitoring
- Blue-team contacts / POCs: to be added
- SIEM rules to watch: phishing click alerts, anomalous logins
- Canaries & kill-switch monitors: unique codeword triggers immediate halt
- Expected alerts: suspicious email, blocked URL access
- Data retention: purge within 30 days after final report delivery

---

## 8. Data Handling & Evidence
- Evidence storage location: `Evidence/Social_Engineering/`
- File naming convention: `YYYYMMDD_target_action.ext`
- Access control: operator and campaign lead only
- Redaction policy: remove PII before sharing outside red-team
- Retention & deletion: delete RAW data after remediation sign-off

---

## 9. Post-Engagement
- Notify client POC immediately after execution
- Schedule debrief within 48 hours
- Provide remediation recommendations
- Offer retest window if requested
- Capture lessons learned and suggested training updates

---

## 10. Results & Findings (fill after run)
- Total contacts: 0
- Click rate: 0 %
