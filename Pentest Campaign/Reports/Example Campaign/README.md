# Example Campaign - Quick Guide

This campaign layout is meant to keep logs and reports tidy.

## Folder outline
- 01-Admin: ROE, scope, asset lists, contacts
- 02-Recon: targets, command log, infrastructure templates
- 03-Enumeration: service notes and potential vulnerabilities
- 04-Exploitation: attempts, payloads, evidence pointers
- 05-Post-Exploitation: privesc, loot, cleanup
- 06-Reporting: findings and final report
- Evidence: screenshots, logs, pcaps, emails, attachments, audio
- Scripts: helper utilities (evidence archiving, finding generation)

Start at [[Overview]]. Use the evidence script for file hygiene, and capture commands in `02-Recon/Command_Log`.
