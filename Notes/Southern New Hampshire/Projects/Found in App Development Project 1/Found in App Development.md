# Found in App Development Project 1

## Deliverables
- `Pet.java` class
- Pseudocode for one method (check-in or check-out)
- Flowchart for the same method
- Paragraph explaining OO concepts (encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction)
- Global Rain Summary Report (pseudocode + flowchart + paragraph)

## Suggested Workflow
1. Review the project guidelines and Pet BAG specification
2. Set up the Codio lab and create `Pet.java`
3. Build the class skeleton (attributes, constructor, getters/setters)
4. Draft pseudocode -> convert to flowchart
5. Write the OO explanation paragraph
6. Assemble the report and submit with `Pet.java`

## Notes
Add reminders or issues you hit along the way.
