## ðŸ’¡ Key Points:

In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs (which used computers extensively for automatic phone call routing) published a book describing a new high-level language with the simple nameÂ C, being named after another language called B (whose name came from a language called BCPL). C became the dominant programming language in the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1985, Bjarne Stroustrup published a book describing a C-based language calledÂ C++, adding constructs to support a style of programming known asÂ _object-oriented programming_, along with other improvements.Â The unusual ++ part of the name comes from ++ being an operator in C that increases a number, so the name C++ suggests an increase or improvement over C.

In 1991, James Gosling and a team of engineers at Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle in 2010) began developing theÂ JavaÂ language with the intent of creating a language whose executable could be ported to different processors, with the first public release in 1995.

The language had a C/C++ style and for portability reasons was designed to execute on a virtual machine. Java was initially intended to be run on consumer appliances like interactive TVs. Web browsers like Netscape Navigator began providing support for running Java programs within the browser, bringing much attention to the language. The Java language continues to evolve for the programming of traditional computers and consumer devices. Java should not be confused with JavaScript, which is an entirely different language used for developing web applications that was named similarly.

A January 2023 survey ranking languages by their popularity, based on programming related searches using popular search engines, yielded the following:
