# Language History

## Timeline Highlights
- Early computing languages focused on math/science (FORTRAN, COBOL)
- Structured programming introduced clearer flow (C, Pascal)
- Object-oriented languages emphasised reuse (Smalltalk, C++, Java)
- Modern languages blend paradigms (Python, Go, Rust)

## Key Ideas
- Abstraction lets developers hide complexity
- New languages often appear to solve productivity or safety gaps
- Legacy languages remain in use because of existing systems
