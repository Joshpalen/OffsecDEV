## ðŸ’¡ Key Points:

- The termÂ _computer_Â has changed meaning over the years. The term originally referred to a person that performed computations by hand, akin to an accountant ("We need to hire a computer.") In the 1940s/1950s, the term began to refer to large machines like in the earlier photo. In the 1970s/1980s, the term expanded to also refer to smaller home/office computers known as personal computers or PCs ("personal" because the computer wasn't shared among multiple users like the large ones) and to portable/laptop computers. In the 2000s/2010s, the term may also cover other computing devices like pads, book readers, and smart phones. The term computer even refers to computing devices embedded inside other electronic devices such as medical equipment, automobiles, aircraft, consumer electronics, military systems, etc.

In the early days of computing, the physical equipment was prone to failures. As equipment became more stable and as programs became larger, the termÂ _software_Â became popular to distinguish a computer's programs from theÂ _hardware_Â on which they ran.

A computer typically consists of several components (see animation below):

- Input/output devices:Â AÂ screenÂ (or monitor) displays items to a user.Â The above examples displayed textual items, but today's computers display graphical items, too.Â AÂ keyboardÂ allows a user to provide input to the computer, typically accompanied by aÂ _mouse_Â for graphical displays. Keyboards and mice are increasingly being replaced byÂ _touchscreens_. Other devices provide additional input and output means, such as microphones, speakers, printers, and USB interfaces. I/O devices are commonly calledÂ _peripherals_.
    
- Storage:Â AÂ solid-state drive (SSD)Â uses flash memory to store files and other data, such as program files, song/movie files, or office documents.Â SSDs areÂ _non-volatile_, meaning they maintain their contents even when powered off. The SSD's flash memory stores 0s and 1s by tunneling electrons into special circuits on the memory's chip and extracting the bits with a "flash" of electricity that draws the electrons back out. SSDs replaceÂ _hard disk drives_Â used in older personal computers. Hard disk drives use spinning magnetic disks that are slower and consume more energy than SSDs.
    
- Memory:Â RAMÂ (random-access memory) temporarily holds data read from storage and is designed such that any address can be accessed much faster than SSD and disk.Â The "random access" term comes from being able to access any memory location quickly and in arbitrary order, without having to spin a disk to get a proper location under a head. RAM is costlier per bit than SSD and disk, due to RAM's higher speed. RAM chips typically appear on a printed-circuit board along with a processor chip. RAM is volatile, losing its contents when powered off. Memory size is typically listed in bits or in bytes, whereÂ aÂ byteÂ is 8 bits.Â Common sizes involve megabytes (million bytes), gigabytes (billion bytes), or terabytes (trillion bytes).
    
- Processor:Â TheÂ processorÂ runs the computer's programs, reading and executing instructions from memory, performing operations, and reading/writing data from/to memory.Â When powered on, the processor starts executing the program whose first instruction is (typically) at memory location 0. That program is commonly called theÂ _BIOS (basic input/output system)_, which sets up the computer's basic peripherals. The processor then begins executing a program called anÂ _operating system (OS)_.Â TheÂ operating systemÂ allows a user to run other programs and interfaces with the many other peripherals.Â Processors are also calledÂ _CPUs_Â (central processing units) orÂ _microprocessors_Â (a term introduced when processors began fitting on a single chip, the "micro-" suggesting something small). Because speed is so important,Â a processor may contain a small amount of RAM on its own chip, calledÂ cacheÂ memory, accessible in one clock tick rather than several, for maintaining a copy of the most-used instructions/data.
    
- Clock:Â A processor's instructions execute at a rate governed by the processor'sÂ clock, which ticks at a specific frequency.Â Processors have clocks that tick at rates such as 1 MHz (1 million ticks/second) for an inexpensive processor ($1) like those found in a microwave oven or washing machine, to 1 GHz (1 billion ticks/second) for costlier ($10-$100) processors like those found in mobile phones and desktop computers. Executing about 1 instruction per clock tick, processors thus execute millions or billions of instructions per second.
    

Computers typically run multiple programs simultaneously, such as a web browser, an office application, a photo editing program, etc. The operating system actually runs a little of program A, then a little of program B, etc., switching between programs thousands of times a second.
