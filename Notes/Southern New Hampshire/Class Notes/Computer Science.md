# How Computers Operate

## Core Components
- **Input / Output** - keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, display, speakers
- **Storage** - SSDs or hard drives hold data when power is off
- **Memory (RAM)** - temporary working space for active programs
- **Processor (CPU)** - executes instructions, uses cache for speed
- **Clock** - controls how fast instructions run (MHz/GHz)

## Concepts
- Software vs. hardware roles
- Operating system starts after BIOS initialises hardware
- Multitasking: OS slices CPU time across many programs

## Notes
Add your own examples or analogies here.
