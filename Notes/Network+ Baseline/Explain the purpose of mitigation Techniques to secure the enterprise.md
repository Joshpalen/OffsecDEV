# Purpose of Mitigation Techniques

Mitigation = actions that lower the likelihood or impact of a threat. Combine multiple layers so one failure does not expose the entire enterprise.

## Examples by layer
- **People** - awareness training, clear policies, background checks
- **Process** - change control, incident response playbooks, vendor risk reviews
- **Technology** - firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoint protection, MFA, encryption
- **Data** - classification, DLP, secure backups, retention policies

## Selecting Controls
- Prioritise high-risk assets and threats
- Choose controls that are practical to operate and monitor
- Validate controls regularly (testing, audits, red team)

## Measures of success
- Reduced number of incidents for a given vector
- Faster detection and response times
- Evidence of compliance where required
