# Why Change Management Matters

## Goals
- Maintain availability and stability when systems change
- Provide accountability (who approved, who implemented, when)
- Allow quick rollback if something breaks

## Core Components
1. **Request** - document the change, reason, scope, and risk
2. **Review/Approval** - technical and business review, scheduling
3. **Testing** - validate in staging or lab whenever possible
4. **Implementation** - follow documented steps, communicate status
5. **Validation** - ensure services operate normally
6. **Post-review** - note lessons learned and update documentation

## Security Impact
- Prevents unauthorized or risky changes
- Ensures controls (firewalls, ACLs, backups) stay aligned
- Supports audit/compliance evidence
- Reduces downtime by planning maintenance windows

## Good Practices
- Keep a "back-out" plan for every change
- Update diagrams / inventories when changes finish
- Use ticketing tools so history is searchable
