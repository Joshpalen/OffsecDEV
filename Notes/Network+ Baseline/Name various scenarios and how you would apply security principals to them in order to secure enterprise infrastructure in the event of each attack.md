# Applying Security Principles to Scenarios

## Scenario Examples
- **Lost laptop** - rely on encryption, remote wipe, and MFA for cloud apps
- **Web application breach** - use secure coding, WAF, and regular testing
- **Insider trying to exfiltrate data** - enforce least privilege, DLP, logging, and reviews
- **DDoS attack** - implement rate limiting, CDN/protection services, scaling plans
- **Cloud misconfiguration** - use templates/policies, IAM reviews, automated scanning

## Principles to apply
- Least privilege (users and services only get what they need)
- Defense in depth (multiple controls at different layers)
- Segmentation (limit blast radius)
- Monitoring and alerting (know when something changes)
- Prepared response (playbooks, communication plans)

## Checklist when analysing a scenario
1. Identify assets and data involved
2. Understand the threat vector
3. Assess current controls and gaps
4. Recommend improvements with priority
