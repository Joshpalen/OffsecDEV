# ðŸ§  Applying Security Principles to Enterprise Attack Scenarios
**Tags:** #security #defense #incident-response #scenarios #principles #offsec  
**Vault:** OffsecDEV  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate how to apply core security principles to defend, contain, and recover from common enterprise attack scenarios.

---

## ðŸ§­ Overview
Security principles provide the foundation for protecting enterprise environments.  
They ensure that every defensive action â€” technical, administrative, or physical â€” supports confidentiality, integrity, and availability (the **CIA Triad**).  
Below are realistic attack scenarios with applied principles.

---

## ðŸ’£ Scenario 1: Phishing and Credential Theft
**Attack:** User receives a fake â€œpassword resetâ€ email that captures credentials.  

| **Principle** | **Application** |
|----------------|----------------|
| User Awareness | Train employees on phishing recognition and reporting. |
| Least Privilege | Compromised user accounts have minimal system access. |
| Defense-in-Depth | Email filtering, DNS reputation, and link analysis tools. |
| Multi-Factor Authentication | Stops logins even if passwords are stolen. |
| Logging & Monitoring | Detect logins from unfamiliar IPs or devices. |

---

## ðŸ§± Scenario 2: Ransomware Infection
**Attack:** Malicious attachment encrypts local and shared files.  

| **Principle** | **Application** |
|----------------|----------------|
| Defense-in-Depth | Use EDR, email scanning, and macro restrictions. |
| Network Segmentation | Contain lateral movement between departments. |
| Backups | Maintain offline, immutable backups. |
| Least Privilege | Restrict write permissions on shared drives. |
| Incident Response | Predefine isolation and restoration steps. |

---

## ðŸŒ Scenario 3: DDoS Attack on Public Web Service
**Attack:** Botnets flood web servers, causing downtime.  

| **Principle** | **Application** |
|----------------|----------------|
| Availability | Use redundancy, failover, and load balancers. |
| Defense-in-Depth | Firewalls, CDNs, and DDoS scrubbing layers. |
| Resilience | Develop disaster recovery (DR) and continuity plans. |
| Automation | Auto-scale infrastructure during spikes. |
| Change Control | Avoid emergency misconfigurations during attack. |

---

## ðŸ§© Scenario 4: Insider Threat â€“ Privilege Misuse
**Attack:** Admin downloads and shares sensitive HR data.  

| **Principle** | **Application** |
|----------------|----------------|
| Least Privilege | Restrict admin rights by function. |
| Separation of Duties | Split system and audit responsibilities. |
| Data Loss Prevention | Block unauthorized data transfers. |
| Accountability | Audit trails and session recording for privileged users. |
| Behavior Analytics | Detect abnormal file access patterns. |

---

## ðŸ§¬ Scenario 5: Zero-Day Exploit in Web App
**Attack:** New unpatched vulnerability exploited in production system.  

| **Principle** | **Application** |
|----------------|----------------|
| Defense-in-Depth | WAF and input validation reduce exploit success. |
| Patch Management | Apply vendor mitigations or virtual patches. |
| Change Management | Control update rollouts with rollback plans. |
| Least Privilege | Run web services with minimal OS rights. |
| Threat Intelligence | Monitor advisories and IOC feeds. |

---

## ðŸ”’ Scenario 6: Third-Party Vendor Compromise
**Attack:** Partner system breached, granting indirect access to your network.  

| **Principle** | **Application** |
|----------------|----------------|
| Zero Trust | Validate every connection â€” internal or external. |
| Network Segmentation | Isolate vendor access zones. |
| Vendor Risk Management | Require audits, certifications, and SOC reports. |
| Access Control | Time-limited, least-privilege accounts. |
| Joint IR Planning | Coordinate response playbooks with vendors. |

---

## âš™ï¸ Scenario 7: Data Exfiltration via Compromised Endpoint
**Attack:** Attacker uses remote access to steal internal documents.  

| **Principle** | **Application** |
|----------------|----------------|
| Encryption | Protect data at rest and in transit. |
| Endpoint Detection | Detect abnormal outbound or encrypted traffic. |
| Network Segmentation | Restrict access to sensitive data zones. |
| Monitoring | Correlate logs to identify exfiltration attempts. |
| Containment | Quarantine infected device and revoke credentials. |

---

## â˜ï¸ Scenario 8: Cloud Storage Misconfiguration
**Attack:** Publicly exposed storage bucket reveals sensitive data.  

| **Principle** | **Application** |
|----------------|----------------|
| Least Privilege | Apply strict IAM roles and policies. |
| Configuration Management | Automate checks for misconfigurations. |
| Data Encryption | Encrypt all cloud data by default. |
| Change Control | Review and approve permission changes. |
| Continuous Monitoring | CSPM and SIEM alerts for exposure. |

---

## ðŸ§© Scenario 9: Supply Chain Compromise
**Attack:** A trusted vendor update installs malicious code (e.g., SolarWinds).  

| **Principle** | **Application** |
|----------------|----------------|
| Integrity Verification | Validate digital signatures on updates. |
| Defense-in-Depth | Sandboxing, source validation, and code reviews. |
| Zero Trust Supply Chain | Vet all dependencies and update sources. |
| Change Management | Test updates in isolated staging environments. |
| Forensics | Retain update and configuration logs for analysis. |

---

## ðŸ¢ Scenario 10: Physical Breach
**Attack:** Unauthorized individual installs rogue hardware in server room.  

| **Principle** | **Application** |
|----------------|----------------|
| Physical Security | Locked rooms, cameras, and access logs. |
| Device Hardening | Disable unused ports and interfaces. |
| Environmental Controls | Tamper sensors and rack locks. |
| Integration | Physical and cyber teams share alert channels. |
| Incident Coordination | Trigger full security response if intrusion detected. |

---

## ðŸ§© Enterprise-Level Application
Security principles are **universal** â€” each reinforces the other:

- **Confidentiality:** Encryption, access control, classification.  
- **Integrity:** Change management, digital signatures, version control.  
- **Availability:** Backups, redundancy, DDoS protection.  
- **Least Privilege:** Limit access and enforce role separation.  
- **Defense-in-Depth:** Multiple overlapping layers of control.  
- **Zero Trust:** Assume breach, verify continuously.  
- **Accountability:** Logs, monitoring, and non-repudiation.  

---

## ðŸ§¾ Summary
Applying security principles consistently across scenarios builds **resilience** â€” not just compliance.  
A principle-driven approach ensures that even if one layer fails, the organization continues to **detect, contain, and recover** effectively.

> **Principles are timeless. Tools evolve â€” discipline doesnâ€™t.**
