# ðŸ’£ Common Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces
**Tags:** #security #threats #attack-vectors #defense #reference  
**Vault:** OffsecDEV  
**Purpose:** Define and explain the most common ways attackers compromise systems (threat vectors) and the exposed components they target (attack surfaces).

---

## ðŸ§­ Overview
Every organizationâ€™s security posture depends on **understanding where attacks originate** and **how adversaries gain access**.  
This requires analyzing two interrelated concepts:

- **Threat Vector:** The *path or method* used by an attacker to exploit a vulnerability.  
- **Attack Surface:** The *total set of entry points* â€” hardware, software, network, or human â€” through which a system can be attacked.

Reducing risk means **minimizing attack surfaces** and **monitoring threat vectors** continuously.

## âš™ï¸ Common Threat Vectors

| Vector | Description | Typical Exploits | Defensive Controls |
|--------|--------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Phishing & Social Engineering** | Deceives users into revealing credentials or running malicious code. | Credential theft, ransomware, BEC scams. | Security awareness training, MFA, email filtering. |
| **Malware** | Software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access. | Viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware. | EDR, antivirus, sandboxing, least privilege. |
| **Exploits & Vulnerabilities** | Attackers leverage coding flaws or misconfigurations. | Buffer overflow, SQLi, XSS, privilege escalation. | Patch management, input validation, secure coding. |
| **Network-Based Attacks** | Exploit insecure protocols or exposed services. | DoS/DDoS, MitM, ARP spoofing, port scanning. | Firewalls, IDS/IPS, segmentation, VPNs. |
| **Insider Threats** | Malicious or negligent employees with authorized access. | Data exfiltration, sabotage, credential misuse. | Access control, behavior analytics, monitoring. |
| **Physical Access** | Unauthorized individuals gaining direct system access. | Device theft, hardware tampering, shoulder surfing. | Badging, surveillance, locks, environmental security. |
| **Supply Chain Compromise** | Insertion of malicious code or hardware via trusted vendors. | Compromised updates, hardware implants. | Vendor vetting, SBOM, integrity verification. |
| **Cloud Misconfiguration** | Exposed cloud services due to weak configurations. | Public S3 buckets, excessive IAM roles. | Cloud security posture management (CSPM), IAM hardening. |
| **API Abuse** | Poorly secured APIs leaking or modifying data. | Data scraping, privilege escalation, DoS. | API gateways, authentication tokens, rate limiting. |
| **Zero-Day Exploits** | Exploitation before a patch is available. | Exploit kits, targeted APT attacks. | Threat intelligence, isolation, behavioral detection. |

## ðŸ§± Understanding Attack Surfaces

The **attack surface** includes all **accessible points** in a system where an attacker can try to enter or extract data.  
It can be divided into several key categories:

### 1. **Digital / Logical Surfaces**
- Operating systems, applications, and services running on endpoints or servers.  
- Includes open ports, exposed APIs, databases, and web applications.

### 2. **Physical Surfaces**
- Devices, network gear, and facilities that can be physically tampered with.  
- USB drives, IoT sensors, badges, and mobile devices are common targets.

### 3. **Human / Social Surfaces**
- Users and administrators who can be deceived or coerced into actions.  
- Includes phishing, pretexting, and insider collusion.

### 4. **Supply Chain / Third-Party Surfaces**
- Vendors, contractors, and partners integrated into operations.  
- Each dependency expands the organizationâ€™s potential exposure.

## ðŸ“‰ Reducing the Attack Surface

| Category | Mitigation Strategies |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| **Systems & Applications** | Remove unused services, patch regularly, use minimal installs. |
| **Network** | Segment critical assets, close unnecessary ports, enforce least privilege. |
| **Users** | Conduct security awareness training, enforce MFA, monitor privileged activity. |
| **Data** | Encrypt at rest/in transit, apply DLP, restrict access by classification. |
| **Cloud & APIs** | Apply IAM best practices, use CSPM, audit keys and permissions. |
| **Physical** | Secure facilities, disable unused physical interfaces (e.g., USB). |

## ðŸ” Relationship Between Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces
Threat vectors exploit weaknesses *through* attack surfaces.  
For example:

> **Phishing (vector)** targets the **human surface**, leading to credential compromise.  
> **SQL injection (vector)** targets the **application surface**, exploiting input validation flaws.

Security strategy focuses on:
1. **Reducing surface area** (limit exposure).  
2. **Hardening existing surfaces** (patch, isolate, encrypt).  
3. **Monitoring vectors** (detect, respond, adapt).

## ðŸ§© Integration with Offsec Operations
In offensive security or red teaming:
- Mapping attack surfaces helps plan **initial access vectors**.  
- Understanding vectors guides **exploit chain simulation**.  
- Documenting findings supports **risk prioritization** and **defensive hardening**.

---

## ðŸ§¾ Summary
Effective defense begins with **knowing your exposure**.  
Minimize what can be attacked, continuously scan for new entry points, and stay informed on evolving vectors used by real-world adversaries.
