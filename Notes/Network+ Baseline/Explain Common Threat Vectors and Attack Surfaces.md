# Common Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces

## Threat Vectors (Ways attackers get in)
- **Social engineering / phishing** - trick users into giving credentials or running malicious files
- **Malware packages** - viruses, trojans, ransomware delivered through attachments or downloads
- **Vulnerability exploits** - take advantage of unpatched software or weak configurations
- **Network attacks** - sniffing, spoofing, denial of service, exposed services
- **Insider misuse** - intentional or accidental misuse of legitimate access
- **Supply chain / third-party** - compromised updates, hardware implants, weak partner controls
- **Cloud/API abuse** - exposed buckets, overly-permissive IAM, unsecured endpoints

## Attack Surfaces (What can be attacked)
- **Digital / logical** - operating systems, applications, services, databases, APIs
- **Network** - open ports, protocols, network devices, wireless access points
- **Physical** - devices, cables, server rooms, removable media
- **Human / social** - employees, contractors, help desks, leadership
- **Supply chain** - vendors, partners, hosted providers

## Reduce exposure
- Remove or harden unnecessary services
- Apply timely patches and configuration standards
- Enforce least privilege and monitor privileged actions
- Segment critical systems and encrypt sensitive data
- Train users and validate third-party security
