# Fundamental Security Concepts

## Core Principles
- **CIA triad** - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- **AAA** - Authentication, Authorization, Accounting
- **Defense in depth** - multiple layers of protection
- **Least privilege** - give only the access required for a task

## Risk Basics
- Risk = Threat * Vulnerability * Impact
- Use assessments to prioritise mitigations
- Track risks through a register and review regularly

## Control Types
- **Preventive** - stop incidents (MFA, firewalls)
- **Detective** - find incidents (logging, IDS)
- **Corrective** - restore service (backups, patches)

## Incident Response Flow
1. Preparation
2. Detection/analysis
3. Containment
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
6. Lessons learned

## Good Habits
