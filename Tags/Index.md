## üß≠ Overview

This file defines and standardizes **all tags** used throughout the vault.  
Tags are used to interlink notes, organize topics, and fuel Dataview queries for dynamic navigation.  
Each section below lists the tag‚Äôs **meaning**, **scope**, and an optional **Dataview query example**.

## üß© Core Structural Tags

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|----------|
| `#reference` | External documentation, guides, cheat sheets |
| `#template` | Note or file template for reuse |
| `#report` | Formal deliverable or campaign output |
| `#evidence` | Screenshots, logs, pcaps, forensic data |
| `#log` | Lab or operational activity record |
| `#concept` | Theoretical or design-level notes |
| `#workflow` | Process or procedure documentation |
| `#project` | Active campaigns or major efforts |
| `#archive` | Completed or deprecated content |

**Example Dataview**
```dataview
TABLE file.name AS "Reference Files"
FROM ""
WHERE contains(tags, "#reference")
SORT file.name ASC
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tool-Specific Tags

| Tag | Tool |
|-----|------|
| `#metasploit` | Exploitation framework notes |
| `#nessus` | Vulnerability scanner results |

SORT file.mtime DESC
```

## üß± Meta-Organizational Tags

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|----------|
| `#priority/high` | Needs attention or review soon |
| `#pending` | Work in progress, not finalized |
| `#todo` | Tasks to complete |
| `#complete` | Finished and reviewed |
| `#core` | Foundational to vault structure |

**Example Dataview**
```dataview
TASK
FROM ""
WHERE contains(tags, "#todo") OR contains(tags, "#pending")
SORT file.name ASC
```

---

## üß© Usage Convention

- Tags appear in front-matter for all notes:
  ```yaml
  ---
  tags: [#tool, #pentesting, #core]
  aliases: [nmap, recon]
  ---
  ```

- Inline tags can also be used for quick linking:  
  `The results were validated using [[Nmap_Note]] #pentesting #tool`

---

## üìä Suggested Folder Integration

| Folder | Example Tags |
|---------|---------------|
| `/Reports/` | `#report`, `#project`, `#evidence` |
| `/Templates/` | `#template`, `#reference` |
| `/Notes/` | `#log`, `#concept`, `#workflow` |
| `/Tags/` | `#core`, `#reference` |
| `/Evidence/` | `#evidence` |

## üß† Tag Governance

**Purpose:**  
To prevent tag sprawl and maintain consistency across the vault.

**Rules:**
1. Always use lowercase tags (except hierarchical tags like `#priority/high`).  
2. Keep tags short, semantic, and re-usable.  
3. Add new tags only if existing ones don‚Äôt capture meaning.  
4. Update this file whenever a new tag is introduced.  

---

## üß≠ Future Enhancements
- Add Dataview dashboards per domain (`Pentesting_Index.md`, `Networking_Index.md`)  
- Auto-generate tag summary tables using Templater scripts  
- Implement color-coded tag CSS snippets in Obsidian for visual clusters
