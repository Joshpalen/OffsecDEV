## üß≠ Overview

Workflows define **how** tasks are performed ‚Äî step-by-step, repeatable methods used throughout your campaigns, research, or maintenance tasks.  
This file acts as your master directory for all procedural documents, lab sequences, and automation scripts.

Use this index to:
- Standardize repeatable actions  
- Quickly recall tool usage sequences  
- Map dependencies between tools, vulnerabilities, and reports  
- Enable faster onboarding or task recovery

## üß† Workflow Governance

**Naming Convention:**  
`<Action>_Workflow.md`  
Examples:  
- `Recon_Workflow.md`  
- `Exploit_Workflow.md`  
- `Report_Workflow.md`  

**Tagging Convention:**  
All workflow notes must include:
```yaml
---
tags: [#workflow, #core]
status: active
---
```

**Version Control:**  
- Each change should include date/version header.  
- Use `status: archived` when deprecated.  
- Cross-link any affected scripts or tools.  

---

## üß© Dataview Summary

```dataview
TABLE file.name AS "Workflow", file.folder AS "Path", file.mtime AS "Last Updated"
FROM "Notes"
WHERE contains(tags, "#workflow")
SORT file.mtime DESC
```

---

## üß≠ Expansion Workflow

When creating a new workflow:
1. Duplicate from the **Workflow Template**.  
2. Add domain and context tags.  
3. Link to relevant tools and vulnerabilities.  
4. Store outputs in `/Evidence/Workflows/<Name>/`.  
5. Update this index and verify it appears in the Dataview dashboard.  

---

## üìú Summary

The **Workflows Index** defines the procedural architecture of OffsecDEV.  
It ensures every recurring process ‚Äî technical, administrative, or analytical ‚Äî is documented, versioned, and connected to the vault‚Äôs taxonomy.

> ‚ÄúA workflow written once saves a hundred hours later.‚Äù
