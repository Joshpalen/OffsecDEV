# 🧨 Vulnerability Index

**Vault:** OffsecDEV_Root  
**Author:** Josh  
**Purpose:** Central catalog and reference for vulnerabilities identified, exploited, or researched within the OffsecDEV ecosystem.

## 🧭 Overview

The **Vulnerability Index** is the unified ledger for all discovered, tested, or mitigated vulnerabilities.  
It connects exploit research (`#pentesting`), mitigation strategies (`#firewall`, `#ids`), and reports (`#report`, `#evidence`) in one queryable map.  

Each vulnerability should have its own note file (e.g., `Vuln_MS17-010.md`, `Vuln_Log4Shell.md`), tagged with `#vulnerability` and related domains.

## 🧩 Vulnerability Metrics (Optional)

```dataview
TABLE count(rows) AS "Count"
GROUP BY status
FROM "Notes"
WHERE contains(tags, "#vulnerability")
```

---

## 🧭 Governance & Tracking

- All vulnerability notes must include the `#vulnerability` tag.  
- Each must contain metadata: `status`, `discovered`, and `source`.  
- Each entry links to at least one tool note or workflow.  
- Updates to mitigations must reference the report or config change.  

**Naming Convention:**  
`Vuln_<Identifier>.md` (e.g., `Vuln_MS17-010.md`, `Vuln_Log4Shell.md`)

---

## 🧩 Expansion Workflow

When adding a new vulnerability:
1. Create note from the **Vulnerability Entry Template**.  
2. Assign proper tags (domain + context).  
3. Add mitigation steps and references.  
4. Link to relevant tools, evidence, and reports.  
5. Verify entry appears in Dataview queries above.

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

| Feature | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| CVSS Scoring Integration | Auto-prioritize vulnerabilities by severity |
| Exploit Script Linking | Connect exploit proof-of-concepts directly |
| Mitigation Verification Logs | Link to firewall / IDS changes |
| Automated CVE Imports | Sync external CVE feeds for correlation |

---

## 📜 Summary

The **Vulnerability Index** unifies vulnerability management, research, and reporting into a single system within the OffsecDEV Vault.  
It ensures:
- Complete traceability from discovery → exploitation → mitigation.  
- Consistent tagging and metadata.  
- Seamless integration with your evidence, reports, and tools.
